HOW TO RECORD VIDEO SEQUENCES

To record video sequences, select Video->Record from the menu bar.
Every snapshot recorded by the video camera will be stored as a file
whose name includes the timestamp formatted as the number of seconds 
in the present day, with microsecond resolution.

The directory into which files are recorded can be specified 
with Video->Directory or from Video->Properties.

The file format for recorded images is a property of the
recorder that can be chosen from the Video->Properties menu.

The recorder spawns multiple processes to improve performance
and minimize dropped frames.  If too few of process threads are
allocated, the recorder may drop frames.  Increasing the number
of threads increases memory usage, and can overload the computer's
storage system.  The number of threads is a property of the
recorder that can be chosen from Video->Properties.
