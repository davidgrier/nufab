HOW TO MOVE THE STAGE

1. Fine stage motion is controlled by holding down the arrow keys.
   The speed can be varied by simultaneously holding down the
   SHIFT or CONTROL keys.
   
   Up, Down, Left, Right: Normal motion
   SHIFT-Arrow:           Fast motion
   CONTROL-Arrow:         Slow motion

2. Fine focus is controlled with the modified
   ALT-Up and ALT-Down arrow keys.

   ALT-Up:   Approach the sample -- DANGER!
   ALT-Down: Back away from the sample
   SHIFT-ALT-Arrow: Fast focus
   CONTROL-ALT-Arrow: Slow focus

Fast and slow speeds are multiples of the base speed
and can be modified under the Stage->Properties menu entry.

3. Motion between sample bays can be controlled from the
   Stage menu:
   a) Calibration: Left-most bay containing a mirror.
   b) Cleaning:    Second bay, which generally is left blank.
   c) Sample 1:    Third bay
   d) Sample 2:    Right-most bay
