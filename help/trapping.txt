HOW TO CREATE AND MANIPULATE OPTICAL TRAPS

1. Create traps by SHIFT-Clicking on the screen.

2, Destroy traps by CONTROL-Clicking on them.

3. Move traps by clicking and dragging them:
   * LEFT-MOUSE .......... drag to translate in the plane.
   * MOUSE-WHEEL ......... roll to translate axially.
   * MIDDLE-MOUSE ........ drag to rotate a group about its center.

4. Group traps with the RIGHT mouse button.
   * RIGHT-Click ......... adds an existing trap to the active group.
   * SHIFT-RIGHT-Click ... creates a new trap and adds it.
   * CONTROL-RIGHT-Click . removes a trap from the active group.
   * RIGHT-DRAG .......... adds traps to the active group from a region.

Traps' colors indicate the current operation:
   * GREEN ............... normal
   * ORANGE .............. rotating

Immutable traps are created programmatically and cannot
be translated or rotated, except under programmatic control.
They can be destroyed by CONTROL-Clicking or with Traps->Clear.
